Organised activities and institutions developed, such as manufacture and trade, art and writing, religion and law, military and political structures. Some of these societies became the focal points of empires which shaped various parts of the ancient world.",

After the collapse of the Roman empire in the west, the Christian church provided the cultural foundation for the emergence of European medieval society. One of the important features of this society was feudalism. Islam, meanwhile, had spread from the Arabian Peninsula and by the mid-seventh century dominated North Africa and the Middle East. In the late eleventh century Christianity and Islam clashed in a series of wars known as the Crusades. The Christian goal of occupying Muslim Jerusalem and the Holy Land ultimately failed. In the mid-fifteenth century the Islamic Ottomans finally captured Constantinople, the capital of the eastern Roman empire. This victory consolidated their empire which then commanded the eastern Mediterranean. In the meantime, western European navigators discovered new trade routes to Asia by sailing around Africa or heading west, across the Atlantic, to encounter the Americas. These voyages opened up a new understanding of the world at a time when western Europe was embracing the learning of ancient Greece and Rome. This expansion of knowledge, experience and confidence is now known as the Renaissance. In Europe it heralded the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment which created the modern world. ",
