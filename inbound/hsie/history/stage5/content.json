An obvious result was urbanisation, but the Industrial Revolution also contributed to other population movements such as the slave trade, emigration and convict transportation. The Industrial Revolution also encouraged European nationalism and imperialism. While the Industrial Revolution created wealth for some and support for capitalism, it also created a new class of urban workers who were forced to endure poor living and working conditions. The resulting social discontent created support for new political ideas such as socialism. At the end of this period, a buildup of tensions among Europe's great powers contributed to the outbreak of World War I, the first global war",

In the aftermath of this war decolonisation saw the end of the great European empires and the emergence of new nations, particularly in Asia and Africa. At the same time, the United States and the Soviet Union emerged from World War II as hostile superpowers armed with nuclear weapons in a tense confrontation known as the Cold War. Despite a peaceful end to the Cold War in 1991, the emergence of global terrorism and a shift in economic power to Asia have contributed to ongoing uncertainty. The period since the end of the twentieth century has also been characterised by rising concerns about issues such as globalisation, the environment and sustainability.
